## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a libary for Arduino, which uses different cameras like the Pixy2 or the OpenMV to track a black line on a white background and can be used to easily control a robot this way. This could be useful for the [RescueLine](https://junior.robocup.org/rcj-rescue-line/ "RescueLine at robocup.org") discipline of the RoboCup Junior.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Basic libary functionality
- [ ] Pixy2 support
- [ ] OpenMV support
- [ ] Releases
- [ ] Documentation
